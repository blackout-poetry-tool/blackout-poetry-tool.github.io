**Dichotomy**
> A division or contrast between two things that are or are represented as being opposed.

A dichotomic lens on the Human-Computer relationship can look towards- 
- Intuition vs Logic

**Whenever there's a conflict between two entites, Peter Elbow [[1]](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/The-Uses-of-Binary-Thinking-Elbow/294d77e512c3eff76b5ddd105277ae489b07cdac) mentions 5 ways of resloving it -**
